# coursera-data-science-projects
Samples from projects completed for the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization on Coursera by the University of Michigan. 

# Associated code available upon request
I cannot publicly share the code associated with my Coursera projects due to Coursera's honor code policy. If I've applied to your company or you are a recruiter and you are interested in viewing a sample of my work, please contact me directly.

The video and images in this repo are samples of work I created as part of the "Data Visualization with Python" course from the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. I have the code I used to create the visualizations in this repo, as well as code for projects associated with other courses in the specialization.
